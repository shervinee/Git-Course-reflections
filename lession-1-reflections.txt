Since the files were more than a typical size for proects, using diff was very efficient and fast 

Having access to different versions of a project first can avoid any lack of info whne debugging and also would open the door for further extensions and branches we wanna have to dvelop a project 

for programming finding the best possible time to keep the changes is really different from case to case and might be subjective, but in case of google Docs since case to case don't matter much as the main purpose is writing a document then committing automatically would actually help having different versions of your doc in mind

The probability of code files being connected to serve a one big purpose is much higher than some document text files 

 first is logging through commmits and second is diff ing the two commits we wanna change and findthe additions and removals 

 Any changes don't seem scary at all, since we can go back and keep changing things as we go on (in fact debugging can be made much easier using these)

 now having the workspace the whole work of git becomes much easier and quicker
