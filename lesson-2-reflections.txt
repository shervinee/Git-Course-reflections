initializing the git repository is the way to making any folder into a repository, without it our repo is not really made, and we need a repository to really do any git with it 

the main value it offers can be said to be managing the actual commit we wanna make, maybe we change our mind to add/remove more files to a commit as we go on.

by using different diff comands (specially diff and diff --staged). Using the two we can control all we wanna add or not add to our project 

any case of adding new features and updates which we don't wanna afect the master branch (because it's in use by users) would need branching

diagram is very useful for having the idea of how many branches we have, how they're getting comitted, what commits are stand-alone and etc.

having two branches sharign all the commits they have, it's important to note that the new commit would have one of the branches as its label so knowing that it would have possible two parent and how git+us handles them is very important 

merging manually gives additional ability for us to add the designed features (branches) inter changably, also giving conflicts would might be annoying but it actually tells us which part of the code are doing the same thing but with differnt signitures so later on we don't get confused
