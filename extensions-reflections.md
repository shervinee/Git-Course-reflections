# Some additional note to brush up memory about git & gitHub written in markdown

## Code Academy:
importance of reset command for un-staging files, and importance of un-staging when having staging multiple things we wanna commit but changing our mind in the middle of the way
command: git reset HEAD file_name


if reset used with a commit SHA we back-trace our commit log to a wanted point and everything else we had after it would be unlinked.
command: git reset Commit_SHA
