First use of remote repositories are when multiple developers are working on the same project. They check other's work add and make the final project a real team work

one of the main reasons of pulling manually can be avoiding any possible conflicts that our local and remote version might cause after merging

branches are always for a single repo (when we wanna get creative)
cloning is for localizing a remote into our own machine
forking is very similar to cloning but on GitHub servers which also gives notifications to the original author
